								<h2>Collecting Nuts for Wildlife</h2>
								<h4>By David Mizejewski</h4>
							</header>
							<p>
								September through early November is the best time to collect nuts.  You can germinate them for planting in 
								your garden and throughout your community, or even to give as gifts.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can also collect seeds to help with local conservation efforts. Many state forestry services have nurseries 
								to grow native trees for use in reforestation and stream bank restoration. They often partner with local nonprofits 
								and watershed groups in nut collecting drives each fall. In addition to the benefit to wildlife, demand for the 
								planting of native hardwood trees has increased to minimize erosion and to restore urban tree canopies to help 
								keep our cities and towns cool.  Trees on river banks can absorb pollutants and prevent them from getting into 
								the watershed.

								<h2>Newly Expanded Reserve</h2>
								<h4>By Les Welsh</h4>
							</header>
							<p>
								In a significant step forward for marine wildlife and our planet’s ocean ecosystems, President Obama last week 
								authorized the expansion of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The President’s proclamation 
								expands the existing monument from 83,000 square miles to 490,000 square miles, making it the largest marine 
								reserve in the world.
							<p>
								By using his authority under the Antiquities Act to expand this protected marine landscape, the President did 
								for the oceans and marine wildlife what he has already done for some of America’s terrestrial landscapes. 
								Presidents of both parties have long used this power for environmental conservation. The Grand Canyon was 
								originally protected as a monument by President Theodore Roosevelt.  More recently, President George W. Bush 
								created four marine national monuments, including the initial protection of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine 
								National Monument.

								<h2>Win for Wildlife</h2>
								<h4>By Kassie Rohrbach</h4>
							</header>
							<p>
								In a landmark decision today, the Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL) rejected a necessary permit for Ambre 
								Energy’s Morrow Pacific coal export project along the Columbia River.  This historic decision deals a severe blow 
								to Ambre Energy’s struggling proposal and marks the first time a Pacific Northwest state agency has formally 
								rejected a permit for one of the proposed coal export terminals.
